## Data Structures Programming Assignment 02: Priority Queues and Disjoint Sets
### Problems
Practice implementing priority queues and disjoint sets and using them to solve algorithmic problems:
* [`/src/make_heap/BuildHeap.java`](src/make_heap/BuildHeap.java): Problem 1, Convert array into heap, converts an array of integers into a heap (PASSED);
* [`/src/job_queue/JobQueue.java`](src/job_queue/JobQueue.java): Problem 2, Parallel processing, simulates a program that processes a list of jobs in parallel (PASSED);
* [`/src/merging_tables/MergingTables.java`](src/merging_tables/MergingTables.java): Problem 3, Merging tables, simulates a sequence of merge operations with tables in a database (PASSED).
